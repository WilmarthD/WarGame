# WarGame
The card game WAR, to be played by a user against the computer.

When running the program, the system will shuffle 2 decks, one for the user and one for the computer. 
From there the two will reveal the top card of their pile, whoever has the higher ranking card places the cards
out in the open in their winnings pile. Once a party runs out of cards in their deck, they must then play with their 
winnings pile instead. If there is a tye in card value on the field, a WAR commences! Each player lays 3 cards 
face down and flips a fourth, where the higher card takes all of the field cards into their winnings pile. This repeats
until only one person has cards left, in which case they are the winner! 
This can an extremely long process, so a skip mode is implemented, activated between any round, that will run the program
automatically until a winner is found.
